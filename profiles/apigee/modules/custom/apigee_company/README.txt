This module allows a monetization developer to have subscriptions under a personal or
company account. For example, if a developer want to have a subscription to certain APIs
for personal use, and other subscriptions to APIs for a company project, they can purchase
these subscriptions separately.

Also, if you purchase a subscription in a company context, you can allow other developers
to create APIs under that subscription.  This is a useful feature to allow one person on
a project to pay for a subscription and then allow all developers on that project use the
subscription instead of each developer paying for their own app access individually.

Installation
------------

Prerequisite: You must have an Apigee Monetization enabled organization.

Install the module as you would any Drupal module. However, this module depends
on some Edge API calls that are only available to Apigee Monetization enabled
organizations.  If your org is not monetization enabled, this feature will
not work.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Problem:
The company features are not working properly.

Solution:
Make sure you have a Apigee Monetization enabled organization.
